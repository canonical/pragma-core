/**
 * Vitest global setup: rebuild every STALE workspace dependency dist before
 * any worker starts.
 *
 * The subprocess suites spawn the REAL bin (`bun src/bin.tsx`), which
 * resolves `@canonical/summon-core` and `@canonical/task` through their
 * `exports` maps into `dist/esm/…` — and the interaction fixtures hard-code
 * those same dist entry files — so a projection edit in summon-core's `src`
 * is invisible to every spawned cell until that dist is rebuilt. Without
 * this gate the two hosts of the parity PR could return opposite verdicts
 * on one change: cli/pragma's suites rebuild their dep dists in their own
 * globalSetup while this package's cells stayed green against the previous
 * generation of the very file under edit.
 *
 * This is cli/pragma's gate (src/testing/perf/globalSetup.ts) minus its
 * compiled-binary half — a faithful SIBLING rather than an import: pulling
 * the shared helpers from `@canonical/pragma-cli` would point a dependency
 * edge summon → pragma-cli, closing a cycle with pragma-cli's declared
 * devDependency on this package. Same honest mtime staleness rule, same
 * main-process-before-any-worker placement (a `beforeAll` inside a worker
 * would race sibling workers importing the same in-place-rewritten files),
 * same loud topo-cycle throw, same cross-process build lock. Runs for full
 * suites and single-file `vitest run <file>` invocations alike.
 *
 * The main-process placement serializes only THIS process's workers. The
 * sibling gate rebuilds four of the same dists (task, ds-types, utils,
 * summon-core) from ITS process, and nothing orders the two suites — so
 * every root ALWAYS enters {@link buildUnderLock}, which takes an O_EXCL
 * lockfile at the root's top level — OUTSIDE every tree the freshness
 * rules stat — and judges freshness only UNDER it: a second process
 * finding the lock waits for release and RE-STATS instead of
 * double-building (two in-place `tsc` rewrites truncating one dist under
 * a live importer). A pre-lock freshness skip existed once and let a
 * contender bless another process's mid-flight emit (the entry lands
 * before `tsc` can fail — measured live), proceeding with no lock
 * against an artifact about to be destroyed; deleting it is what makes
 * one consistent pre-worker generation true. A lock that never clears
 * fails loudly after a timeout instead of forever.

 * Serialize one root's rebuild across PROCESSES with an `O_EXCL` lockfile

 * OUTSIDE every tree the freshness rules stat. The lock's own
 * create/unlink is a directory mutation, and a lock kept beside the
 * served artifact inside `dist/**` bumped a directory the sibling gate's
 * `DEP_INPUTS` watches on EVERY entry, so a fully fresh tree re-judged
 * `dist/pragma` stale and rebuilt the binary on every vitest invocation
 * (measured); the root's own mtime, by contrast, is watched by nothing —
 * only its named children are. The file must also stay UNTRACKED: the
 * root-level home sits outside the ignored `dist/`, so `.dist-build.lock`
 * has its own root `.gitignore` rule — a committed lock (crash residue
 * swept into a `git add -A`) would block every clone's every run for the
 * full timeout, with a "delete the file" remedy git keeps undoing. The
 * next relocation must keep BOTH properties: outside every watched tree,
 * and inside an ignore rule. One root serves ONE dist artifact, so
 * root-scoped is artifact-scoped, and both sibling gates compute the
 * same path for the same root — contention still meets contention.
 * Freshness is decided ONLY under the lock: callers enter
 * unconditionally, with no pre-lock fast path — a stat taken outside the
 * lock can land inside another process's emit-to-exit window (`tsc`
 * emits the entry before it can fail) and bless a mid-flight artifact
 * without waiting on anything. The holder stats after acquiring and
 * builds only if stale, so an uncontended fresh root pays one
 * open/unlink and nothing else; a contender waits for release and then
 * loops back to ACQUIRE the lock itself and re-stat UNDER it — a
 * lock-free existence-then-freshness probe is two unsynchronised
 * observations, and between them a new holder can take the lock and
 * begin an in-place rebuild whose mid-flight mtimes the probe blesses —
 * building only when the re-stat still reads stale, which a FAILED
 * holder guarantees: a `build` callback whose build RAN and failed
 * destroys the served artifact before
 * rethrowing, because a failed build can still EMIT it (nothing sets
 * `noEmitOnError`, so `tsc` writes output and exits nonzero, and the
 * two-step builds' first step writes the entry before the second can
 * fail) — mtime alone cannot tell a failed build from a clean one —
 * while a spawn failure with NO child (`error` set and `signal == null`)
 * leaves the artifact alone: no builder ever ran, nothing was emitted,
 * and the dist on disk is still the previous good generation, stale by
 * the same stats that sent the holder in. A
 * lockfile that never clears (a killed builder) fails loudly after
 * {@link LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS} naming the file, rather than double-building
 * or waiting forever. RESIDUAL, accepted: since every entry takes the
 * lock, crash residue blocks EVERY later run for the full timeout until
 * the file is removed (pre-existing wait semantics — no stale-lock
 * reclaim is attempted).
