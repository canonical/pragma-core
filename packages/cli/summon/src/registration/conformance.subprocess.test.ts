/**
 * PROTECTED — summon's side of the byte-equality seam.
 *
 * The guarantee is that both product binaries generate the same tree from the
 * same generator and the same answers. Until now that was asserted only from
 * PRAGMA's package: pragma's kernel path was diffed against summon-core's
 * `execute`, and this package had no tests at all (`--passWithNoTests`), so the
 * summon BIN — the Commander/Ink front-end over that same core — could drift
 * and nothing would catch it.
 *
 * This runs the real bin in its own PROCESS, exactly as a user does
 * (`summon example hello --name=… --yes`), and diffs its tree against
 * {@link produceReference} — the shared definition of the seam in
 * `@canonical/summon-core/testing`. Three generators are covered —
 * `example/hello` (templates, a conditional file, EJS helpers),
 * `example/webapp` (a framework/styling matrix, a multiselect, parallel
 * effects) and `init` (a nested output path) — the three builtin leaves
 * the bin ships, and a declaration tie on the builtin dir keeps this
 * matrix honest: a fourth shipped leaf reddens it here instead of
 * arriving covered by nothing.
 *
 * Subprocess, not in-process, deliberately: the bin's write path goes through
 * Ink's `render`, and the risk being guarded is precisely that the front-end
 * adds or drops a byte around the core. A non-TTY child is the CI shape, and it
 * is the shape asserted here.
