/**
 * Embedded-pack parity gate
 *
 * Fails when the graph snapshot the CLI ships
 * (`src/kernel/runtime/graphpack/embedded/pack.generated.ts`) cannot be shown
 * to match the pack sources `pragma.conf.ts` declares.
 *
 * Where it lives, and why: this is ONE package's data-provenance concern — it
 * reads this package's config and this package's committed embed — so it lives
 * in this package's `scripts/` and runs through this package's own `check`
 * (local mode) and `test` (its bun suite), which the root fan-out and the
 * build matrix already cover. Do NOT copy `scripts/check-workspace-ranges.ts`
 * here as a precedent for a root script + dedicated pr.yml job: that guard is
 * a genuine repo-wide invariant over every workspace sibling, which is what
 * earns shared CI infrastructure.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The CLI answers store-backed reads offline from a committed snapshot. That
 * snapshot is refreshed at release time by
 * `.github/actions/lerna-version/refresh-pack.sh`, which is token-gated and
 * skips loudly when no token is supplied (#1042). An honest skip is not a
 * gate: v0.36.0 shipped a snapshot whose manifest still said `0.34.0`, with
 * `@canonical/code-standards` built from commit `ab7ae14` while the config
 * pinned tag `v0.1.5` (= `fcd3ac2`) — a revision from BEFORE the upstream
 * `cs:name` → `rdfs:label` migration. `standard list` then published names
 * that `standard lookup` could not resolve, and no bar had turned red at any
 * point between the upstream change and the user hitting the break.
 *
 * What this gate proves — and what it cannot
 * ------------------------------------------
 * The embed's manifest records per-pack provenance
 * (`<name>@<git|npm|self>:<resolved>`). The declared sources come in two
 * strengths, and the gate is honest about the difference:
 *
 * - A source pinned to a TAG or SHA (today: `@canonical/code-standards` at
 *   `#v0.1.5`) has a stable referent, so equality is a stable predicate: the
 *   gate resolves the pin upstream and REQUIRES the recorded commit to match.
 *   This is the check that would have caught the v0.36.0 staleness.
 *
 * - A source floating on a BRANCH (`#main`) has no stable referent — the
 *   branch moves, so "recorded == resolved" is true or false depending on
 *   when you ask, and asserting it would make the gate red whenever upstream
 *   merges between bundle and check. For those packs the gate proves
 *   FRESHNESS instead: in release mode the manifest's `version` must equal
 *   the version being released, and the self pack must record
 *   `self:v<version>`. The bundler stamps both only when it actually ran, so
 *   this proves the snapshot was rebuilt during THIS release — its floating
 *   inputs were resolved at release time, not inherited from a previous tag.
 *   What it cannot prove is that the branch did not move in the minutes since
 *   the bundle ran; that window is inherent in declaring a floating ref, and
 *   the only way to close it is to pin (see the code-standards rationale in
 *   `pragma.conf.ts` — falsifiability is exactly why that pack IS pinned).
 *
 * Coverage is checked unconditionally and offline: the manifest must carry
 * exactly one provenance entry per declared pack, on the resolution lane the
 * bundler is committed to (`embedSources.ts`) — git for a git source, npm for
 * an overridden one, self for the repository's own pack.
 *
 * Release mode — a tested capability, deliberately NOT wired into the release
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `--release-version <v>` adds the freshness predicate above and makes an
 * unresolvable pin fatal; `--accept-committed-snapshot` waives freshness and
 * unverifiability — NEVER a coverage violation or a pin mismatch the gate
 * managed to prove: a human may accept "possibly stale", no one may accept
 * "provably wrong". Nothing in CI passes these flags: wiring this into the
 * release pipeline (`.github/actions/lerna-version`, where the pack refresh
 * runs) was considered and deliberately left out — CI workflow changes are
 * global infrastructure with their own bar (see AGENTS.md). What that leaves
 * OPEN, stated plainly: `refresh-pack.sh` still skips loudly without a token,
 * and a release can still ship a snapshot that does not match its declared
 * sources with no bar turning red. Until that wiring exists, the release-mode
 * flags are the MANUAL check: run
 * `bun run check:packs --release-version <v>` before cutting a release. The
 * mode stays (rather than being stripped) because its semantics — the
 * tag/branch asymmetry, the waiver rules — are pinned by this script's bun
 * suite, so the future wiring is a one-step action change instead of a
 * re-derivation.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run check:packs                          # local mode (runs in `check`)
 *   bun run check:packs --release-version 0.37.0 # release mode (manual today)
 *   bun run check:packs --release-version 0.37.0 --accept-committed-snapshot
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = parity holds (as strongly as each declared ref allows),
 * 1 = at least one fatal finding.
