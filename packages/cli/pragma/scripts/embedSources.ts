 *
 *
 * `@canonical/ds-implementations` is COLLECTED FROM this monorepo into the root
 * `data/` directory, and `pragma.conf.ts` declares it as a git ref on `#main` —
 * the correct source for a real user, and the wrong one for the bundler at
 * release time. The version job regenerates that data with the new version and
 * its `versionedLink`s and THEN bundles, all BEFORE `git-commit.sh` makes the
 * commit and tag, so a clone of `#main` would embed the PREVIOUS release's
 * implementation graph into the artifact tagged for this one. The self-pack
 * therefore reads the working tree, which is exactly the tree that becomes the
 * tag, and records `self:v<version>` as its provenance.
