 * Writes `docs/reference/` from the live capability grammar WITHOUT compiling

 * before the `tsc` emit; this script isolates it so `bun run scripts/genReference.ts`
 * is a sub-second doc refresh. Importing `build.ts` does not trigger a compile —
 * its build block is guarded by `import.meta.main`.
