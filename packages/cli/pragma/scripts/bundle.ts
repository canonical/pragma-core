/**
 * Compile the embedded pack — and the bundled skills — from `pragma.conf.ts`.
 *
 * Resolves the distribution's own declared packs through the PRODUCT's pipeline
 * (`parsePackDeclaration` → `resolvePackage` → `buildPack`, with `sources
 * update`'s own prefix precedence) into a throwaway cache, then inlines the five
 * artifacts as escaped JS strings, across four generated modules (the carried
 * `stories.json` gets its own so the dispatch path never loads the n-quads). Inlining (rather than shipping file assets)
 * is what lets the pack travel with the emitted modules with no asset step, so a
 * cold install answers store-backed reads offline.
 *
 * NOT byte-reproducible, and deliberately does not try to be: `data.nq`'s blank
 * node labels and `schema.json`'s SHACL value order are store-order artifacts.
 * Instead the script writes NOTHING when everything the committed manifest
 * asserts — its `contentHash` over the resolved TTL inputs AND the `prefixes`,
 * `version` and `sourceRef` this script supplies — is unchanged. Re-running
 * against unchanged upstream sources therefore produces a zero diff, which is
 * strictly stronger than byte-reproducibility. The one thing the skip cannot
 * see is a TOOLCHAIN change with unchanged inputs; that is caught rather than
 * silent (`probe.test.ts` and `wasmEmbed.test.ts` both boot the committed embed
 * on every test run), and deleting `pack.manifest.generated.ts` forces a full
 * regeneration — that is the module `readCommittedManifest` reads to decide
 * whether the pack changed, so it is the one whose absence means "rebuild".
 *
 * THE SAME RESOLUTION ALSO SHIPS THE PACKS' SKILLS. Every pack this script
 * clones has its `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` on disk at the moment the graph is
 * read out of it, and until now that was thrown away with the throwaway cache:
 * a fresh install answered `block lookup` offline and listed ZERO skills.
 * {@link writeBundledSkills} copies them into the committed `bundled-skills/`
 * directory at the package root — the skills half of the snapshot the graph
 * already had. It runs OUTSIDE the unchanged-skip below, for two reasons: a
 * directory copy IS byte-reproducible (unlike the n-quads), so re-running
 * against unchanged upstream still produces a zero diff without a skip; and the
 * manifest's `contentHash` covers the resolved TTL inputs ONLY, so a pack that
 * edits a SKILL.md and no `.ttl` is invisible to it — skipping on that hash
 * would silently ship the previous release's skills forever.
 *
 * Needs the network (a shallow clone per git pack), so it is NOT part of
 * `build` / `build:all`: a PR build must not clone three repositories, and the
 * artifacts are committed. It runs in exactly two places — a maintainer's
 * deliberate `bun run bundle`, and the release's version job
 * (`.github/actions/lerna-version`), which refreshes the snapshot into the
 * tagged commit so a fresh install never ships a graph weeks behind its own
 * release. The zero-diff-on-unchanged-inputs property above is what makes that
 * release step free of churn.
