/**
 * Progressive-disclosure resolution.

 * A verb renders at one of {@link DETAIL_LEVELS}. The effective level is chosen

 * config's `detail`, the verb's own `disclosure.default`, and finally the
 * built-in `"standard"`. Every source is validated upstream (the flag by
 * `readDetail`, the config field by `z.enum` at load, a spec default by the
 * pack grammar), so the fall-back here is a last belt against a source added
 * later without validation — output never fails on disclosure.
