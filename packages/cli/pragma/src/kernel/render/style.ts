/**
 * Terminal-styling seam for the human (TTY) output path.

 * interactive terminal earns color and alignment. A {@link RenderStyle} carries
 * that decision as data so a pure renderer can consult it without reading the
 * process itself: {@link defaultStyle} probes chalk's own TTY/env detection (the
 * same signal the help system leans on), so piped / redirected / MCP output —
 * where `enabled` is false — renders byte-for-byte as before, while an attended
 * terminal renders with `enabled: true`. Passing an explicit style keeps the
 * beautified renderers deterministically testable in both modes.
