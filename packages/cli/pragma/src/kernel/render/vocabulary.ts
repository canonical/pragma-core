/**
 * The rendering vocabulary — the ONE place a state and the word for it meet.
 *
 * `doctor` reports states, `setup` plans and applies them, and both speak to
 * the same reader about the same machine. For as long as each surface spelled
 * the states itself — three glyph tables, two scope-label maps, two indent
 * constants — the type layer and the copy layer were free to disagree, and a
 * copy pass could rename a scope in every sentence while the model underneath
 * kept the old word. This module ends that freedom: the statuses, their
 * glyphs, the scope names, and the shared layout markers are each defined
 * once, here, and every renderer reads them.
 *
 * The SCOPES are **global** and **local project**, chosen because they are the
 * words the user already typed: `--global` and `--local`. Reading `Local
 * project` above a row whose fix is `pragma setup mcp --local` is the whole
 * point — the report names the flag that repairs it. (Earlier these surfaces
 * said MACHINE/PROJECT, and later "global band"/"project band": a third and a
 * fourth term for the same two things, and "band" is a word nobody outside
 * this repository has ever used for a config scope. The type layer carried
 * "band" longest — `ScopeBand`, `PlanRow.band`, a `bands.ts` — and the render
 * tests now guard against either spelling coming back.)
 *
 * The GLYPHS are one small alphabet with fixed meanings, so the same mark
 * never says two things: `✓` is work done or verified, `✗` is a real fault,
 * `◇` is available-but-not-set-up, `○` is inert (nothing to act on), and `·`
 * is neutral punctuation — a sub-item bullet, or a row that never ran. Doctor
 * and setup map their own status tiers onto that alphabet below, which is what
 * keeps a failed setup row and a failed doctor row — the same finding seen
 * twice — wearing the same mark.
 *
 * This is the RENDERING vocabulary; the graph-domain vocabulary a distribution
 * declares (`kernel/vocabulary.ts`) is a different thing with the same good
 * reason for existing. Like the rest of `kernel/render/`, this module is
 * statically reachable from the `--help`/`__complete` fast paths, so it
 * imports NOTHING — it is inert data plus two pure one-line functions.
