/**
 * The closed set of pragma error codes.
 *
 * Every {@link PragmaError} carries one of these; the CLI projector maps each
 * to a process exit code and the covenant freezes the exit-code table. Ported
 * from the v1 error kernel with two additions for the v2 exit model:
 * `STORE_UNAVAILABLE` (its own exit code, D2) and `UNKNOWN_VERB` (the usage
 * class the unknown-command suggester resolves to). A store failure is either
 * `STORE_UNAVAILABLE` (can't reach it) or a plain `INTERNAL_ERROR`, so no
 * distinct `STORE_ERROR` code is carried.
