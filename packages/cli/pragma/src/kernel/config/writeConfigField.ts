/**
 * Write a single field into the global config, as a Task.
 *
 * A mutation, so it lives on the effect seam: `writeConfigField` returns a
 * `Task` the dispatcher interprets (node interpreter to apply, dry-run to
 * preview). It merges the field into the existing global document — a value of
 * `undefined` removes it — and writes the whole document back. Only the global
 * layer is writable; project configs are authored by hand.
 *
 * The Task effect vocabulary has no rename effect, so the write is a single
 * `WriteFile` (the interpreter creates the parent dir) rather than the
 * temp-file-plus-rename the v1 sync writer used — the closest atomicity the
 * effect model expresses. If the existing file is corrupt (unparseable), it is
 * backed up to a timestamped sibling before the overwrite — consistent with the
 * read path (globalConfig) so a torn write is never silently discarded.
