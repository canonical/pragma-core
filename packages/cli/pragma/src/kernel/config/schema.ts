/**
 * Zod validation for a config layer.
 *
 * One of the three sanctioned zod seams (validate.ts / mcp/registerVerb.ts /
 * config/schema.ts) — never reached from the `--help` or `__complete` fast
 * path, which are storeless and config-free. Validates the raw shape a global
 * JSON file or an evaluated `pragma.config.ts` declares; unknown keys are
 * stripped for forward compatibility, and only present keys survive so layer
 * merging keeps honest per-field provenance. Legacy shapes are NOT left to the
 * unknown-key stripping: each is detected before validation and rejected with
 * a loud CONFIG_ERROR naming the file and the fix, so an old config fails
 * telling the user exactly what to change instead of silently ignoring the
 * field. Three today: the `packages` key (renamed to `packs`), and the removed
 * `completion.caseSensitive` and `generators` fields (each validated and read
 * by nothing).
