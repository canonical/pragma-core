/**
 * `runComplete` — the `__complete` resolver entry point. THE PROTOCOL:
 *
 * Invocation: `pragma __complete -- <word1> … <current>`
 * - The bin fast-paths `argv[0] === "__complete"` literally, BEFORE
 *   global-flag parsing, Commander, config reads, or first-run — the resolver
 *   is storeless and config-free by construction. The first `--` after
 *   `__complete` is protocol framing and is stripped by the bin (tolerated
 *   absent). A later bare `--` belongs to the user's command line and is
 *   honoured as end-of-options by the state machine.
 * - Words are the raw argv after the program name, up to and INCLUDING the
 *   word being completed — the LAST word is the partial (possibly empty).
 *   Words after the cursor are never sent. A leading word equal to the bin
 *   name is stripped (some shells include it).
 * - Output: matching candidates, newline-delimited, on stdout. Zero
 *   candidates → zero bytes. Nothing else is ever written to stdout.
 * - Exit code: ALWAYS 0. `runComplete` never throws — any internal error
 *   degrades to zero candidates so TAB never breaks a shell.
 * - stderr is silent unless `PRAGMA_COMPLETE_DEBUG=1`, which logs the
 *   classified context, "nothing" reasons (unknown noun/verb, exhausted
 *   positionals, reserved completion kinds), dropped unsafe candidates, and
 *   timing.
 * - Shell floors: bash ≥ 4 (mapfile), zsh ≥ 5, fish ≥ 3. bash splits words at
 *   `=` (COMP_WORDBREAKS), so the state machine treats `=` tokens around a
 *   value-taking flag as transparent.
 *
 * The static scripts (see `emitScripts`) answer structure without exec and
 * invoke `__complete` only for `{kind:"names"}` value contexts; the resolver
 * is nevertheless a complete standalone answer for EVERY context, so the
 * whole grammar is testable through this one function.
