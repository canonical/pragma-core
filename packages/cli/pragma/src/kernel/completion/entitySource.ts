/**
 * The dynamic-tier seam: where `{kind:"names"}` completions get their candidates
 * for EVERY object family, plus the storeless pack-index read the resource
 * browser (`info`, `doctor`, MCP prompts, the resource provider) shares.
 *
 * {@link indexCompletionEnv} is the one source-dispatched reader wired at the
 * `__complete` fast path (bin) and the `__complete` verb. It resolves three
 * storeless sources — all disk-readable, never a store/SPARQL:
 * - `index`    → the active pack's `index.json`, filtered by a prefixed `type`
 *                and read from the declared `field` (`name` by default).
 * - `skills`   → SKILL.md names via {@link discoverSkills} (filesystem walk).
 * - `prefixes` → the pack index's prefixes ∪ the default display prefixes.
 *
 * There is no per-family source. An entity family IS a `type` filter plus the
 * field that family is addressed by, and both are declared at the verb, so this
 * module names no entity type at all.
 *
 * The index is loaded once (lazy `readFileSync` + plain `JSON.parse` — never a
 * store, facade, config evaluator, or zod schema; any I/O or parse error
 * degrades to `[]`) and shared across the index and prefixes sources;
 * the skills walk is memoized to one walk per `__complete` process.
 * {@link createIndexEntityReader} exposes the index read for the storeless
 * behavioural/safety tests; {@link emptyNameSource} is the default (no names).
 *
 * {@link readPackIndex} and {@link entityTotal} expose the same storeless read
 * to `info`/`doctor` and the resource surfaces — but those callers are NOT on
 * the fast path, so `readPackIndex` takes the boot decision rather than
 * re-deriving one. Everything here relies only on the FROZEN `{ name, type }`
 * index minimum (plus optional enrichment like `label`/`altNames`), so the
 * index can grow without breaking completion.
 *
 * Storeless-graph notes:
 * - The embedded fallback is read from `pack.index.generated` — its OWN
 *   generated module (only the index string) — so the storeless `__complete`
 *   path never EVALUATES the n-quads/schema/manifest strings that live in
 *   `pack.generated`. Under the compiled binary it did not avoid PARSING them
 *   either — one emitted script meant the whole embed was parsed at process
 *   start on every invocation (~+25 ms, measured on `--version`; BUDGETS.md
 *   records it), and the split bought only that a completion never allocated
 *   the 1.87 MB. Shipping per-module output changed that: `pack.generated` is
 *   a separate module the fast path never imports, so it is no longer parsed
 *   at all there. The split now buys both.
 * - The active pack is resolved through `kernel/runtime/paths` — a LEAF module
 *   (node builtins only) that shares the pointer read with `resolveSources`.
 *   `resolveSources` itself is unreachable from here: it pulls the graphpack
 *   manifest schema (zod), which `safety.test.ts` forbids on this graph, and
 *   `origins.packs` needs the config evaluator. So {@link loadActiveIndex}
 *   implements only the POINTER half of the decision table — pointer → that
 *   pack (else nothing), no pointer → the embedded snapshot. It cannot tell a
 *   fresh install from a project that declared its own packs and never built
 *   them, so a `__complete` in the latter still offers the snapshot's names.
 *   That is the price of a config-free fast path, and it is bounded to
 *   completion candidates: every read, and every surface that takes the
 *   decision, refuses. `PackIndex`/`PackIndexEntity` are imported type-only, so
 *   no zod schema is loaded at runtime.
 * - `discoverSkills` (`node:fs/os/path` only) and `DEFAULT_PREFIX_MAP` (whose
 *   domain half the distribution declares) are the only new edges — both
 *   leaf-clean, so the fast path stays free of boot/config/store/zod.
