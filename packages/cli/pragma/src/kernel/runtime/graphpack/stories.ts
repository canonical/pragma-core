/**
 * Read the read stories the ANSWERING pack carries.
 *
 * It CONSUMES the one boot decision ({@link resolveSources}) rather than
 * re-deriving it, so the nouns a project's reads answer with can never differ
 * from the nouns its pack carries: a project pointed at its own pack gets that
 * pack's stories, a fresh install gets the embedded snapshot's, and a
 * configured-but-unbuilt project gets none (its reads refuse too).
 *
 * Total: any unreadable or unparseable `stories.json` yields `[]`. The records
 * are RAW TEXT — validating them is `kernel/packs/collect.validateStories`'s
 * job, behind one guard, because a third-party story must never break a command.
 *
 * The embedded snapshot's records come from their OWN generated module, so
 * reading them costs a small string and never loads `pack.generated.ts`'s
 * ~1.9 MB of n-quads (a measured +28 ms on every invocation).
