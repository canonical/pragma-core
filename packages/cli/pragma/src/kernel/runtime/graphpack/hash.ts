/**
 * The two content hashes a pack carries — kept in distinct roles, never
 * conflated.
 *
 * 1. {@link contentHash} — a SHA-256 (ke-graphql's `sha256Hex`) over the
 *    canonicalized *source inputs* (sorted by path, path + content joined with
 *    fixed delimiters). It names the pack's cache directory and is what a
 *    project's active-pack pointer holds, so the same sources always resolve to
 *    the same directory and a
 *    changed source is a new directory (free invalidation). Hashing the sorted
 *    TTL *inputs* — never the `data.nq` dump, whose n-quads line order is not
 *    canonical — keeps it deterministic.
 * 2. `hashSources` (re-exported from ke-graphql) — an order-independent FNV-1a
 *    64 fingerprint stored *inside* `schema.json` as the extraction's freshness
 *    token. ke-graphql compares it against the loaded sources to detect a stale
 *    artifact. It is a staleness signal, not a cache key.
