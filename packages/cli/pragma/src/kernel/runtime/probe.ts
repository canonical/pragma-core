/**
 * The `__store-probe` diagnostic — boot the embedded pack and report a count.
 *
 * Its whole reason to exist is the PROCESS BOUNDARY: it exercises the full
 * store-boot path (oxigraph WASM load, n-quads cache load,
 * `compileFromExtraction`, a SPARQL count) so a spawned smoke test can prove the
 * WASM and the embedded pack load from what actually ships. A silent store-boot
 * failure in the shipped artifact is the one failure vitest's in-process suite
 * cannot catch, so this is the guard (`wasmEmbed.test.ts` spawns it). Storeless code never imports it — the bin
 * fast-paths it behind a dynamic import.
