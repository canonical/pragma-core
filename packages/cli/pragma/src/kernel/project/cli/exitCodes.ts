/**
 * Process exit codes for the CLI projector (D2).
 *
 * The covenant freezes exactly four ERROR-CLASSIFICATION codes: success, a
 * generic runtime failure, a usage failure, and an unavailable store.
 * {@link mapExitCode} routes every {@link ErrorCode} into one of them — usage
 * errors the shell can fix, a store that is not reachable, and everything else
 * as a runtime failure.
 *
 * COVENANT NOTE — out-of-band codes bypass {@link mapExitCode} by design. The
 * dispatch catch sets two codes DIRECTLY, never through the map, so the frozen
 * `{0,1,2,3}` classification set is untouched:
 *   - a deliberate cancel (declining the confirm gate / an at-prompt Ctrl-C)
 *     exits {@link EXIT.OK} (0) — a user choice, not a failure; and
 *   - an interrupt ({@link EXIT.INTERRUPTED}, 130) — a run aborted by SIGINT or
 *     an in-wizard Ctrl-C mid-execution, following the UNIX 128+SIGINT
 *     convention. It is intentionally out-of-band from the four error codes and
 *     is NOT produced by `mapExitCode`.
