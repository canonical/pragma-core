/**
 * SEC-2 path jail: an independent guard that a `create` output path stays inside
 * the workspace, run BEFORE any effect. It rejects an absolute path, a `..`
 * escape, and — via `realpath` on the nearest existing ancestor — a symlink that
 * points out of the tree. This is defence in depth: the generators' own prompt
 * validators (`validateComponentPath`, `validateAppPath`) reject absolute/`..`
 * uniformly across the declared path prompts — in BOTH hosts, upstream of this
 * jail — so the jail is pragma's host-level backstop, and its symlink check is
 * the one tier the shared validators do not have (summon relies on the
 * validator tier; hoisting the realpath check into the shared layer is a named
 * follow-up).
