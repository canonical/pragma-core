/**
 * Formatters for `create` — plain / llm / json over a {@link GeneratorResult},
 * plus the dry-run plan render.
 *
 * Free of any RUNTIME summon-core import, and of any Ink import: the
 * `GeneratorResult` type is imported type-only (erased) and the effect
 * inspection uses `@canonical/task`, which the kernel already loads. This
 * module sits on the capabilities barrel, so `--help` and `__complete` pay its
 * import cost on every spawn — the same reason `create.verb.ts` keeps even the
 * UI-free projection subpath off its static graph. So a verb spec carrying
 * these formatters never pulls summon-core onto the `buildProgram` / `--help`
 * / `__complete` fast paths, and never pulls React.
 *
 * The plan render matters because pragma and summon scaffold through the SAME
 * projection: the two bins write byte-identical trees, so a preview that
 * described that work differently in each was a difference with nothing behind
 * it. {@link formatCreatePlan} therefore consumes summon's own rules rather
 * than restating them — the rows, the connectors and the closing line are
 * whatever `@canonical/summon-core/format` says they are.

/**
 * Render a `create --dry-run` plan: the generation summon would describe.
 *
 * The kernel's default render dumps every effect the interpreter recorded,
 * which for a generator means the internal `Exists` probes, the output
 * directory once per file it holds, and the generator's own log lines — a
 * transcript rather than a plan. {@link visiblePlanEffects} is the filter that
 * already exists for exactly this, and {@link formatEffectLine} the row.
 *
 * Nothing is stashed on the runtime for this: a generator's plan is not known
 * until the preview interpreter has walked the Task, so the effects ARE the
 * plan data. That also keeps `--dry-run --format json` untouched, since the
 * kernel adds its `targets` key only for a verb that stashed something.
 *
 * ASYNC because the formatter is loaded LAZILY, from the light `/format`
 * subpath — the same dynamic edge `registerVerb.ts` uses for the MCP plan
 * payload, so both surfaces reach one module and neither puts it on the fast
 * paths. A dry run is already several filesystem reads deep by the time this
 * is called; a `--help` spawn never calls it at all.
 *
 * COLOUR is decided HERE and handed to the formatter, never left to chalk's
 * own environment detection. pragma's gate is `defaultStyle()`, which demands
 * an attended stdout as well as a usable chalk level: nx exports `FORCE_COLOR`
 * to every test task, so a piped preview would otherwise carry escapes that
 * the rest of pragma's renderers — and `doctor.render.test.ts`'s pin on
 * redirected output — do not.
 *
 * @param effects - The effects the previewed run recorded, in order.
 * @param verbose - If true, the generator's debug logs stay in the plan.
 * @param style - The colour decision; defaults to pragma's own render gate.
 * @returns The rendered plan, without a trailing newline.
