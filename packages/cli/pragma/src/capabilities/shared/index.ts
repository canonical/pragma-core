/**
 * The cross-capability shared surface — the few facts more than one capability
 * needs and none of them owns.
 *
 * Everything here earned its place by being needed in two capabilities at
 * once, and the cohesion principle is that shortness of the list. `shared/` is
 * not a utility drawer: a helper used by exactly one capability belongs in
 * that capability, and the moment something here has a single consumer again
 * it should move back. What survives is the environment the CLI reports on but
 * does not own — how it was installed, what the registry says about it,
 * whether a subprocess it ran actually succeeded. (The scope labels that keep
 * `setup` and `doctor` calling the two config scopes by the same names used
 * to live here too; they are part of the rendering vocabulary now —
 * `kernel/render/vocabulary.ts` — beside the statuses and glyphs they are
 * printed with.)
 *
 * The exec guard is exported as the pair a caller needs together: `checkExecOk`
 * to classify a result inside a Task and `assertExecOk` to throw on one
 * outside, with `guardMissingBinary` wrapping the absent-binary case that
 * neither should report as a pragma bug. The predicates they are built from
 * stay internal — a caller reaching for the predicate instead of the guard is
 * a caller about to reimplement the classification.
