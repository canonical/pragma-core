/**
 * The `doctor` run body: the unscoped environment checks plus the scoped rows
 * the setup target table derives.
 *
 * Two kinds of finding live in one report and they are not the same kind. The
 * ENVIRONMENT checks — the Node version, this CLI's own version, pack refs, the
 * store — diagnose things `setup` cannot install; they carry no scope and stay
 * their own section. The SCOPED rows are the setup targets, in both scopes,
 * named with the target ids verbatim and repaired by the target's own command
 * — plus, per scope, the `harnesses` inventory row: a listing of what this
 * machine holds and where pragma stands in it, which is the thing the targets
 * are measured against rather than a target itself. Adding a target adds its
 * rows here for free.
 *
 * Checks are started eagerly (they run concurrently) and collected in
 * declaration order for a deterministic report. Each is guarded so a thrown
 * check becomes an attributable `fail` rather than aborting the whole run.
 * Lazily imported by `doctor.verb.ts`, so neither the checks nor
 * `@canonical/harnesses` land on the fast path.
