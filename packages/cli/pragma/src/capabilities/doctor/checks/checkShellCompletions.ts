/**
 * Check that shell completions are installed AND up to date AND functional.

 * Three gates, in order:
 * 1. The resolver answers (`completeProbe` drives `runComplete` end to end) —
 *    the effect every installed script depends on. A failure here is a real
 *    regression, so it fails even when nothing is installed.
 * 2. The installed script is present AND is a script `setup completions` would
 *    write. Bytes, not existence: a file that merely exists proves nothing — a
 *    user upgrading across a grammar change keeps the old script, loses the
 *    moved nouns from TAB, and used to be told everything was fine. The path
 *    and this project's body come from `detectCompletions`, the ONE owner of
 *    that decision; {@link isUntunedScript} is what keeps a per-project
 *    `completion` config from condemning a global file (see its docblock).
 * 3. For zsh, `~/.zfunc` is on `$fpath` — the activation step setup can only
 *    hint. Installed-but-unwired reports a distinct remedy.
 *
 * Fault tiers: a broken resolver, a stale installed script, or an unwired zsh
 * install are `fail` — something that exists does not work. A script that was
 * never installed is `available`: completions are opt-in and a fresh install
 * is healthy without them.
 *
 * The detection is passed IN rather than re-read: the `completions` target
 * detects once per invocation and both the setup plan and this row read that
 * one answer, so the two surfaces cannot describe different files.
 *
 * @param cwd - The project directory (the resolver's entity seam).
 * @param d - The `completions` target's detection for this invocation.
 * @returns A CheckResult: pass (up to date + wired + answering), available
 *   (never installed, with the setup remedy), fail (with the attributable
 *   remedy), or skip (shell undetected).
 * @note Impure — reads the install path, `.zshrc`, and drives the resolver.
