/**
 * Check that the local store boots, reporting the entity total and boot time.
 * The check is NAMED "store" in the report — the same word every other surface
 * uses for it; the ke library it boots through is an implementation detail.
 *
 * This is the ONE check that touches the store — it boots the shared lazy store
 * inside a try/catch, so doctor stays storeless-by-default at the dispatch level
 * (the verb declares `needsStore: false`; only this check pays the boot, only
 * when reached). On success it reads the entity total from the session's
 * storeless index rather than a fresh triple COUNT — cheaper, and the store is
 * already booted.
 *
 * @param rt - The per-invocation runtime.
 * @returns A CheckResult: pass with the entity total, or fail with a remedy.
 * @note Impure — boots the store.
