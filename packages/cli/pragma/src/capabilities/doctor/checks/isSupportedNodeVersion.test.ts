/**
 * Pins the hand-written comparison in `isSupportedNodeVersion` to the range the

 * suite closes that by building a SECOND, independent predicate directly from
 * the declared range string and requiring both to agree across a version grid.
 * A change to `engines.node` therefore moves the oracle and fails here until the
 * implementation is moved with it — which a table of hand-written expectations
 * could not do, since its cheapest repair is editing the expectations.
