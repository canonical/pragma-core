/**
 * The hidden `__complete` verb — the dynamic shell-completion resolver.
 *
 * Declared as a verb so the grammar is the single registry (every command is a
 * verb, even internal ones), but `hidden` so it never shows in help or the
 * surface, and withheld from MCP with a reason. The bin fast-paths `__complete`
 * for latency; this spec's lazy `run` is the same resolution — the full
 * completion engine, fed by the active pack's index through
 * `indexCompletionEnv(runtime.cwd)` — reachable if a future tier dispatches it.
 * Storeless: the entity tier reads the index off disk, never booting the store.
