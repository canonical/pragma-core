/**
 * Plan the symlink install of package-provided skills (U10).
 *
 * Design-system packages ship a top-level `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, but skill
 * discovery only scans the project root and the installed-skills root — never a
 * resolved package's clone/dir. So `sources update` INSTALLS each package's
 * skills into the installed-skills root (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/<bin>/skills`) as
 * symlinks, exactly the root `discoverSkills` already reads. Precedence is
 * preserved (a project `.<bin>/skills` entry still wins — it is discovered
 * first), and the update Task stays reversible (each created link carries an
 * unlink undo).
 *
 * Installing alone leaks, because planning walks the PACKAGES and so only ever
 * visits a skill that still exists. When a package DROPS one (a `0.1.2` that
 * shipped `component-specifier` upgrading to a `0.2.0` that does not), the link
 * the previous update installed is never revisited and is left dangling at a
 * target that no longer exists — which reads as a broken install rather than the
 * intentional removal it is, and which `skill` commands can still list or try to
 * open. So planning ALSO walks the installed root and prunes those, under a
 * deliberately narrow rule: an entry is removed only when this run did not plan
 * it AND it is a symlink whose target is gone. A real directory is a
 * manually-installed skill and a still-resolving symlink is someone's own link;
 * neither is this update's to delete.
 *
 * Decisions run against REAL fs here so the update's `--dry-run` plan is
 * accurate; the composed Task performs only the symlink/delete effects.

/**
 * Plan the CONVERGE-ONLY refresh of the global scope's harness skill links.
 *
 * The reported bug lives here. `sources update` installed and pruned layer 1
 * and stopped, so a new pack skill reached no harness directory until the user
 * separately ran `setup skills`, and a dropped one left its layer-2 link
 * dangling with nothing that would ever clear it. This closes the loop, under
 * two rules that are the entire safety argument:
 *
 * 1. CONVERGE-ONLY. `dirs` are directories that already exist — this function
 *    never creates one, and the caller composes no `mkdir`. A `sources update`
 *    that materialised `~/.claude/skills` would be litter, and would silently
 *    opt the user into linking they never asked for.
 * 2. OWNERSHIP, by the SAME test `setup skills` uses. A path is this command's
 *    to touch only when it holds a symlink resolving INSIDE one of the global
 *    scope's roots (`withinAnyRoot`, a pure path-SEGMENT test that reads nothing
 *    — so it still answers correctly after the layer-1 target is gone, which is
 *    exactly the stale case). A real directory is a hand-installed skill; a
 *    symlink pointing anywhere else is the user's own; a `<root>-backup/foo`
 *    sibling is not "inside" despite sharing a string prefix. None is removed.
 *
 *    THE SET, NOT JUST THE INSTALLED ROOT, and that is what keeps precedence
 *    true one layer up. A harness link left pointing at the BUNDLED snapshot
 *    for a skill this update has just installed for real is owned, so it is
 *    `replaced` onto the installed copy. Tested against the installed root
 *    alone it read as "someone else's link" and was skipped — and the user who
 *    deliberately ran `sources update` would have kept running the shipped copy.
 *
 * The plan is derived from the layer-1 plan rather than from a filesystem
 * re-read, because at planning time the layer-1 writes have not happened yet:
 * `surviving` is the post-update truth, and reading the disk would see the
 * pre-update state. That is also why a surviving name always targets
 * `roots[0]`: layer 1 is about to hold it, whether or not it does now.
 *
 * A RETIRED NAME IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY DEBRIS any more. The fallback roots
 * (today: the bundled snapshot) are NOT written by this update, so their
 * contents ARE readable at plan time — and a skill the packages dropped that
 * the shipped snapshot still carries is still discoverable, still listed by
 * `skill list`, and so still belongs in the harness directory. Such a link is
 * RETARGETED onto the surviving root rather than pruned; only a name no root
 * provides at all is deleted.
 *
 * @param dirs - The EXISTING global link directories.
 * @param roots - The global scope's source roots in PRECEDENCE order.
 *   `roots[0]` is the installed root (layer 1) every surviving name targets;
 *   the rest are fallbacks a retired name may still resolve in. The whole set
 *   is the ownership set.
 * @param surviving - Folder names layer 1 will hold after this update.
 * @param retired - Folder names layer 1 is pruning in this update.
 * @returns The layer-2 actions, for the plan and its effects.
