/**
 * `setup config` — seed the global config file with `{}`.
 *
 * This target exists because the seed used to happen BEFORE consent: a
 * first-run pipeline step wrote `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<bin>/config.json` on every
 * non-help invocation, so a read-only command mutated the machine and a banner
 * interleaved itself into mutating runs. The config layers already treat the
 * missing file as "every field at its built-in default", so nothing needed the
 * write except honesty about provenance — which is exactly the kind of thing a
 * consented setup run is for.
 *
 * Split into `detectConfigFile` (a real read of the file and its contents) and
 * the pure compose/removal bodies, like every other target.
 *
 * Removal is ownership-checked: the seeded file is deleted ONLY while it still
 * parses to `{}`. A config the user has edited is theirs, and `--undo` reports
 * that it kept it rather than quietly taking a machine's settings with it.
