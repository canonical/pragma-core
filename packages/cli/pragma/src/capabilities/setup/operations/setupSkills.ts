/**
 * `setup skills` — symlink discovered skills into harness skill directories.
 *
 * SCOPE-MATCHED: the scope picks the source root AND the link destination, and
 * the two always match.
 *
 * - global (the default): INSTALLED skills (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/<bin>/skills`, where
 *   `sources update` puts package skills) AND the BUNDLED snapshot this package
 *   ships (`bundled-skills/`, last in precedence) link into user-level harness
 *   skill directories — the cross-client `~/.agents/skills`, plus the user-level
 *   directory of each detected harness whose user-level location is verified.
 *   The global scope is therefore a root SET, and every rule below that used to
 *   read one `sourceRoot` ranges over it: what a skill resolves to (first-seen
 *   wins, so an installed skill beats the shipped copy), what this command
 *   OWNS, and what its stale sweep is entitled to touch.
 * - project (`--local`): PROJECT skills (`<cwd>/.<bin>/skills`) link into the
 *   project's harness directories — the checked-in, team-shared arrangement.
 *
 * Cross-scope linking is what this replaces: linking installed skills into a
 * repository's directories leaks machine state into a checkout, and linking a
 * repository's skills into the home directory applies one project's skills
 * machine-wide. Neither is ever what the user asked for.
 *
 * A BUNDLED SKILL IS LINKED, NOT COPIED, and that is a decision about who owns
 * the target directory. Every other link this command writes points into a
 * directory pragma controls (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/<bin>/skills`, or the user's own
 * repository); a bundled one points into the package directory, which the
 * PACKAGE MANAGER owns and may move or delete without telling us — a pnpm or
 * npx layout puts the version in the path, so an upgrade leaves the link
 * dangling. Copying would avoid that and cost more than it saves: `linkState`
 * classifies a real directory as `other`, and this module treats `other` as
 * hand-placed and never touches it. So a copied skill could never be updated,
 * never be retired, and never be removed by `--undo` — pragma would be writing
 * permanent, silently stale directories into `~/.claude/skills`.
 *
 * A dangling link, by contrast, the reconcile ALREADY repairs, and this was
 * checked rather than assumed: `detectSkills` classifies a link that does not
 * resolve to the current skill as `replaced` (delete + relink) whatever it
 * points at, so the next `setup skills` — or the layer-2 pass `sources update`
 * runs — moves it onto the new package directory. The one thing that had to
 * change is ownership: `withinRoot` against the installed root alone read a
 * bundled-pointing link as somebody else's and skipped it, so the sweep and the
 * relink both range over the root SET now ({@link withinAnyRoot}). The residual
 * window is between an upgrade and the next reconcile, which is the same window
 * a `sources update` link into a cleared ref cache already has.
 *
 * Split into `detectSkills` (discovery, harness detection, and the per-link
 * create/skip/replace DECISION, all against the real filesystem up front, so
 * the plan and the recap reflect true state) and pure compose bodies performing
 * only the symlink/delete effects the dry-run interpreter mocks.

 * fact, and telling a user their directory "is absent" while they are looking
 * at it is a wrong diagnosis, not a terse one. {@link
 * SkillsDetection.rootExists} is the flag that separates the two states
 * everywhere else in this module, so it separates them here too, and both
 * callers pass it rather than each re-deciding the wording.

 * installed" on its own is a dead end: a reader has no way to know that skills

 * the global root is filled ONLY by `sources update` (skills ship in the
 * configured packages, not in this CLI), and the local project's is a directory
 * the user fills by hand.
