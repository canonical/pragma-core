 * counts a third is how "Setup complete — ran: completions, lsp, mcp" came to
 * be printed on a run that had silently dropped a target. Here the recap is the
 * preview with outcomes filled in, so the two cannot describe different runs.

 * Column widths are computed from the rows being rendered, so the block stays
 * aligned whether it holds one row or seven. Colour rides the shared TTY seam —

 * the Ink view mounts no React until the FIRST prompt effect. So the facts were
 * sitting in `run.plan` the whole time with nothing rendering them — the wizard
 * leaked detection only through prompt-label suffixes, and `renderPlanTable` is
 * reached only by `--dry-run` or the non-interactive preview. A wizard run
 * never rendered it at all, and the confirm gate shows an EFFECTS summary, not
 * a detection one.
 *
 * It is a plain-string formatter on purpose. It rides `rt.report` — the non-Ink
 * stderr seam, `--quiet`-aware and a no-op over MCP — because pragma contains no
 * React and no Ink, and three PROTECTED tests exist to keep it that way.
 *
 * The default lists DETECTED rows only; `--verbose` lists everything. "Detected"
 * is `action !== "skip"`, which is not a new partition: it is exactly the
 * predicate the row multiselect already uses to build its choices, so the
 * summary and the question that follows it describe the same set.
