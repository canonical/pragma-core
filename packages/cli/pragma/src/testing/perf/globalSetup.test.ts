/**
 * Unit pins for the gate's per-root build-or-destroy wrapper — the loop's

 * nothing: a dropped rmSync (restoring the false green) or a restored
 * destroy-on-spawn-error (deleting a good dist the builder never touched)
 * stayed invisible to every suite until a real CI build failed. Drives the
 * EXPORTED wrapper in a tmpdir with an injected runner — no real builds,
 * no subprocesses. TWIN: cli/summon's globalSetup.test.ts pins the sibling
