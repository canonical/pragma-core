/**
 * B6 — the cross-noun disclosure SWEEP, de-duplicated against PR3's own unit
 * coverage.
 *
 * PR3 already ships `disclosure — canonical-index gating` / `resolveDetail
 * precedence` / `MCP detail param` as protected MECHANISM tests
 * (`kernel/packs/disclosure.test.ts`). PR4's job is different: prove the
 * mechanism holds across EVERY noun that actually opts into disclosure — not
 * re-testing precedence or gating, just sweeping the noun SET. Parameterized
 * over `liveReadSurface.ts`, filtered to verbs whose `VerbSpec.disclosure` is
 * actually declared (today: `block`, `standard` — `modifier`/`token` declare
 * no disclosure spec at all, verified against the live pack definitions, so
 * they are correctly excluded rather than assumed).
 *
 * The per-field comparison is CONTENT-AGNOSTIC (key-set growth, not a named
 * field) so the sweep needs no per-noun knowledge of which field is "the deep
 * one" — canonical `digest`->`standard` rename (PARITY_GAPS
 * `digest-renamed-standard`) is exercised implicitly: gating is by canonical
 * index, and the sweep never names a level string other than the three
 * canonical ones.
