/**
 * E4 (AV-231, Backlog E) — the interactive TTY journey. SCAFFOLD.
 *
 * No test in the suite ever drove a REAL terminal, so the interactive-cancel and
 * no-freeze guarantees (H1–H3, C3/C4) were never exercised end to end. Confirming
 * them needs a pseudo-terminal: spawn the compiled `pragma` under a PTY, send raw
 * keystrokes (Ctrl-C = `\x03`, EOF = `\x04`), and observe the exit code + output.
 *
 * `node-pty` is NOT available in this environment (it is a native addon, absent
 * from the dependency set — verified at authoring time), so the journey is
 * scaffolded as `it.todo` behind a `node-pty` availability gate rather than
 * blocking the P0 work. Each todo names the exact behaviour and the exit contract
 * the CLI already promises (see `kernel/project/cli/dispatch.ts`):
 *
 *  - H1: an at-prompt Ctrl-C is a DECLINE — a clean cancel, "Cancelled." on
 *    stderr, exit 0 (`EXIT.OK`).
 *  - H2: a Ctrl-C DURING execution is an INTERRUPT — aborts work underway,
 *    "Cancelled." on stderr, exit 130 (`EXIT.INTERRUPTED`, 128 + SIGINT).
 *  - H3: `create 2>/dev/null` must not freeze — interactivity gates on stderr
 *    being a TTY, so a redirected stderr picks the non-interactive strategy
 *    instead of mounting an invisible wizard that blocks on stdin.
 *  - C3: EOF (`\x04`) on a prompt resolves to a usage error, never a hang.
 *  - C4: an empty select (Enter on a no-default list) does not hang.
 *
 * TODO(AV-231/E4): when `node-pty` (or an equivalent PTY shim) is on the
 * devDependency set, replace each `it.todo` with a PTY-driven `it` that spawns
 * the shipped `pragma create …` under a pty, writes the keystroke, and asserts the exit
 * code + "Cancelled." line. The shipped entry is already provisioned for the
 * spawn-e2e layer by `testing/perf/globalSetup.ts`.
