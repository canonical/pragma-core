/**
 * B10 — the LIVE `__complete` candidate contract over the live read surface.
 *
 * The full completion engine (`kernel/completion`: parse → resolve → rank, the
 * spec-derived model, the entity seam) owns the unit-level guarantees; this
 * pins the behaviour end-to-end against the LIVE capabilities and — for the
 * entity tier — against a REAL built pack index on disk (the built-pack branch
 * of the storeless reader, which the engine's own tests exercise only via the
 * embedded fallback). Parameterized over the live read surface so noun/verb
 * renames never churn it.
 *
 * The engine's `runComplete(words, modules, env)` is async and never throws;
 * the entity tier is fed by `indexCompletionEnv(cwd)` — a storeless read of the
 * active pack's `index.json`, never a store boot.
