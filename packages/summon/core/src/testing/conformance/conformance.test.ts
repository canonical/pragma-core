/**
 * The conformance suite's own tests.
 *
 * The suite is what other packages assert WITH, so a bug in it reads as a false
 * pass in both binaries at once — the worst possible failure mode for a shared
 * guarantee. It is therefore exercised here on a self-contained generator this
 * file declares (no fixture generator is imported from a consumer: summon-core
 * sits below both bins and must not reach up).
 *
 * What is proven: a snapshot is the tree's files in sorted order and nothing
 * else; a diff names each way two trees can diverge; and `produceReference`
 * really does run the seam — it writes the generator's files AND stamps them,
 * into a directory it can be told about or one it makes itself.
