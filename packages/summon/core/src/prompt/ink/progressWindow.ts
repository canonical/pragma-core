/**
 * Pure helpers for the wizard's live progress view (C7/M7): keep each completed
 * effect on ONE line by middle-truncating long paths, so a big application
 * scaffold's progress does not wrap and jitter. Paired with rendering the
 * completed lines under Ink's `<Static>` in `Wizard.tsx` — which is what
 * actually stops the full-history re-render on every effect (the flicker/scroll
 * root) — this keeps the live frame to a bounded, single-line-per-effect window.
 *
 * Truncation is DISPLAY-WIDTH aware, not UTF-16-code-unit aware. It iterates
 * whole Unicode code points (so a supplementary-plane character is never sliced
 * between its surrogate halves into a lone-surrogate `�`), and it counts East
 * Asian Wide / Fullwidth / emoji code points as two terminal columns — because
 * Ink lays the line out by cell width, so a code-unit cap alone would still let
 * wide glyphs overflow and wrap. {@link measureDisplayWidth} is the shared
 * width approximation both concerns rely on.
 *
 * Width is also STYLE-invariant: SGR escape sequences (the bytes `chalk` emits
 * for `<Text color="green">`) occupy no cells, so {@link stripStyles} removes
 * them before anything is counted. Whether the process happens to have colour
 * enabled therefore cannot change how wide a row measures — see that helper for
 * why that mattered.
 *
 * A `.ts` sibling of the JSX view so the string math is unit testable.
