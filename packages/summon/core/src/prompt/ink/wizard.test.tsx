/**
 * PROTECTED: the embedded #819 wizard renders the full flow — prompt sequence
 * → preview/confirm → completion — against a seam-backed
 * {@link SessionController}, exercised with ink-testing-library.
 *
 * Two layers, split on purpose:
 * - the FLOW test drives phase transitions through the controller API (no
 *   fake-TTY input at all), so what it protects — that every phase renders
 *   correctly — is deterministic;
 * - the KEYBOARD-BINDING tests each render one prompt and drive it with one
 *   idempotent keystroke, proving the component→controller wiring. Renders
 *   are sequential and unmounted between tests (Ink's reconciler is a
 *   process-global; overlapping live instances can stall frames). The fake
 *   stdin can deliver writes LATE under load, so no test sends input whose
 *   duplicate or delayed arrival changes state — the old monolithic
 *   keystroke drive typed multi-character values, and one late-arriving
 *   duplicate garbled the field and wedged every later phase, which was a
 *   recurring CI-only flake.
 *
 * Controller-only cancellation semantics are covered in session.test.ts.

/**
 * The two colour states Ink can render the same frame in. Ink styles through
 * `chalk`, and `chalk` decides at import time whether the process's stdout looks
 * like a terminal: a bare `vitest` run gets NO escapes, while a run under a task
 * runner that allocates a pseudo-terminal — which is exactly how CI invokes this
 * suite, via `nx affected -t test` — gets them. That is an accident of the
 * invoking shell, not of the wizard, so these tests PIN it instead of inheriting
 * it: every progress assertion below runs once bare and once styled, and must
 * hold identically in both. Leaving it inherited is what let a row that measured
 * 72 columns locally measure 91 in CI.
