/**
 * The single, UI-free execution point for running a generator or setup Task
 * for real.
 *
 * Every binary — pragma's kernel, summon's Ink TUI — runs its tasks through
 * here. Interactivity is injected as a `promptHandler`, so this core never
 * imports a UI toolkit; the terminal front-ends own that. Centralising
 * execution here gives every command the same working-directory semantics and
 * a single seam where cross-cutting behavior (progress, interception) can be
 * added without touching the callers.
 *
 * Moved into summon-core (from the v1 cli-core) so it sits below both the
 * summon bin and the pragma kernel — the shared seam the byte-equality
 * guarantee rests on, and the one `testing/conformance/produceReference` runs.
 * Both bins import it from HERE; the cli-core re-export shim is gone with that
 * package.
