/**
 * Build an `onEffectStart` seam callback that prepends the generated-file

 *
 * This is THE stamping path: every binary that stamps generated output does so
 * through this one transform on the shared executor's seam, so `pragma create
 * X` and `summon X` write byte-identical files.
 *
 * @param stamp - The stamp configuration (generator name/version).
 * @param next - An optional downstream `onEffectStart` (e.g. progress UI),
 * invoked after stamping.
 * @returns The composed `onEffectStart` callback.
