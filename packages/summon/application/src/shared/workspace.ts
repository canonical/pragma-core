/**
 * Detect whether a directory would be claimed as a member of an enclosing bun
 * workspace, walking up from the directory and matching each ancestor's
 * `workspaces` globs against the relative path.
 *
 * Why this matters for scaffolding: bun resolves `patchedDependencies` paths
 * from the WORKSPACE ROOT, not from the member package. An app-local
 * `patchedDependencies` block inside a workspace makes `bun install` abort
 * ("Couldn't find patch file") and leaves the entire workspace's node_modules
 * unlinked — so the generator must emit patches only for standalone apps.
 *
 * Semantics mirror bun/npm workspace resolution:
 * - The nearest ancestor whose `workspaces` globs cover the directory wins.
 * - Ancestor package.json files without a matching `workspaces` field do not
 *   stop the walk (an intermediate plain package does not detach the app from
 *   an outer workspace root for patch resolution).
 * - The directory itself is never its own enclosing root — an app that IS a
 *   workspace root resolves patches from itself, which is the standalone case.
 * - Both the array form (`"workspaces": [...]`) and the object form
 *   (`"workspaces": { "packages": [...] }`) are accepted.
 * - Globs support `*`/`?` within a path segment and `**` across segments —
 *   the subset bun and npm document for workspace member patterns. Negation
 *   patterns are not interpreted.
