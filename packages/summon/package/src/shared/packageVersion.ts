/**
 * This package's own published version, used as the semver line for the
 * `@canonical/*` config dependencies the templates emit (the fixed-version
 * train means our version IS the train's version).
 *
 * Not a `package.json` JSON import: the relative path (`../../package.json`)
 * is measured from the source file, and the `src → dist/esm` build emits this
 * file one level deeper, so the same specifier resolves to `dist/package.json`
 * — which does not exist. That breaks Node from `dist/esm` AND breaks any
 * bundler that resolves the compiled entry (the CLI's `bun build --compile`
 * fails outright). The sibling `PACKAGE_NAME` sidesteps this with a constant;
 * the version cannot be a constant, because releases bump `package.json`
 * mechanically and a constant would drift silently on the first one. Walking
 * up from THIS module's location is correct from `src/` and from `dist/esm/`
 * alike, with no build-layout coupling to re-break.
 *
 * Lazy and cached deliberately: nothing is read at module load, so importing
 * this module performs no IO and cannot throw at startup.
 *
 * A `bun build --compile` host is the one layout the walk REFUSES to serve:
 * no `package.json` exists inside the binary's virtual `/$bunfs` filesystem,
 * and walking PAST it would probe the real filesystem root — so
 * {@link findOwnVersion} throws immediately from a `/$bunfs` anchor. Such a
 * host captures this package's version at BUILD time — from the very
 * manifest the walk would find — and injects it through summon-core's
 * embedded store (`setEmbeddedPackageVersions`), so a compiled run resolves
 * the same value a source run walks to. The walk stays primary: on disk it
 * can never be stale.
 *
 * @note Impure on first call — reads the filesystem, then caches.
