/**
 * Load a template file eagerly, with compiled-binary support.
 *

 * `bun build --compile` binary the `.ejs` files are not on disk, so the loader
 * falls back to an EMBEDDED MANIFEST injected by the host via
 * {@link setEmbeddedTemplates} — a map keyed by DIRECTORY-QUALIFIED path
 * (`component/<framework>/<file>`), compiled into the binary as inline strings.
 *
 * The directory-qualified key is what fixes the historic basename collision:
 * several component templates share a basename across frameworks
 * (`types.ts.ejs`, `index.ts.ejs`, `styles.css.ejs`, `stories.ts.ejs` exist in
 * `react/`, `svelte/` and `lit/`). The previous fallback matched embedded blobs
 * by BARE BASENAME, so a compiled binary could silently emit the WRONG
 * framework's template (whichever blob was encountered first). Matching on the
 * framework-qualified suffix instead guarantees the right framework's file.
