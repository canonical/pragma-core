 *   overlay applied per term. Annotations change HOW the ontology projects,

 *   no type, no root fields. A007 aggregates the dropped set once; a field

 *   (never String-fallbacked — that would leak entity IRIs as raw strings).
 *   The TBox stays complete for browsing, but an unexposed class's

 *   paginates is definitionally typeable into the emitted schema.
