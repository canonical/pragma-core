/**
 * Run Passes 2–7 over a RawExtraction and assemble the CompilerResult.
 *
 * Every pass still runs to completion and contributes its diagnostics (the
 * tsc model — nothing aborts mid-pipeline), but ANY error-severity
 * diagnostic — from the extraction seed through composition — refuses the
 * compile: the full list is thrown as a CompilationError. An error diagnostic
 * means the schema is missing something the ontology declared (a dropped
 * field, an unregistered class, a failed extraction query), and a schema
 * minus silently dropped fields must never be served — a boot dies loudly
 * instead. Warnings and infos never abort. Pure — every pass after
 * extraction is store-free.
