// The meta-class: owl:Class as a TBox-local ClassNode value.

// OntologyClass implements Node, and Node's contract requires `_meta.type` on
// every node. The honest class of a CLASS is owl:Class — a fact the
// extraction already holds (instanceStats carries owl:Class with the count of
// declared classes). This node is deliberately NEVER inserted into
// ir.classes: an IR entry would make the emitter mint a generated type for
// it, and the meta-class is contract surface, not ontology surface.
//
// The label and comment prose are the OWL vocabulary's own (rdfs:label
// "Class", rdfs:comment "The class of OWL classes." in the published
// owl: namespace document), not an invention of this compiler.
