/**
 * Per-harness MCP entry SHAPES — the registry column that turns "what does a
 * pragma server entry look like in THIS harness's config file" into data.
 *
 * One hardcoded `{command, args, cwd}` shape used to be written for every
 * harness, which was wrong wherever a harness's own schema demands a different
 * shape: OpenCode's `McpLocalConfig` requires `type: "local"`, takes `command`
 * as a STRING ARRAY (command + args combined), spells its env map
 * `environment`, and declares `additionalProperties: false` — so the shared
 * shape was rejected three ways over (S1-3). A serializer per harness fixes
 * the CLASS of bug, not the one symptom: both the writer and the read-back
 * classifier consume the same serialized shape, so "already configured" stays
 * byte-for-byte what a write would emit and idempotence holds per harness.
 *
 * Shapes verified against each tool's own documentation (fetched 2026-08-27):
 * - OpenCode: https://opencode.ai/config.json (`$defs.McpLocalConfig` —
 *   required `["type","command"]`, `command: string[]`, optional `cwd`,
 *   `environment`, `enabled`; `additionalProperties: false`).
 * - Cursor: https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp (stdio entries carry
 *   `type: "stdio"` + `command` + optional `args`/`env`).
 * - Copilot CLI: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/add-mcp-servers
 *   (local entries: `type: "local"`, `command`, `args`, `env`, `tools`).
 * - Crush: source @7944b8e (`internal/config/config.go` `MCPConfig` —
 *   `type` required with enum `stdio|sse|http` and NO load-time default;
 *   `command`, `args`, `env`; no `cwd` field; published `schema.json` stamps
 *   `additionalProperties: false`).
