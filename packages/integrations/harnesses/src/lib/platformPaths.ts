 * value. Detection and config resolution take a `PlatformEnv` rather than
 * touching `process`/`os` directly, so a test drives any OS + env matrix by
 * handing in a fixture.
 *
 * Exercised is not validated: the fixture seam lets the unit tests EXERCISE the
 * linux / darwin / win32 / WSL arms deterministically, and this file reports
 * 100% coverage — but coverage only proves the code ran, not that the paths are
 * right. Only the linux arm runs on the CI host; the darwin / win32 / WSL /
 * `$USER` mappings are the conventional best-guess locations (env-paths style)
 * and have NOT been confirmed against a real macOS / Windows / WSL machine.
 * Treat them as unproven guesses until AV-287 validates them on real hosts.
