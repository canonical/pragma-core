/**
 * Drive a task to its final value synchronously, resolving each leaf effect
 * through `resolveEffect`. This is the shared engine behind the preview
 * interpreters (`dryRun`, `dryRunWith`, `collectEffects`) and the undo
 * collector (`collectUndos`): like the production `runTask` interpreter it
 * realises bind and error-recovery on an explicit continuation/handler-frame
 * stack rather than by recursing through the task structure, so arbitrarily
 * long `flatMap`/`gen` chains run in constant call-stack depth.
 *
 * `resolveEffect` returns the value a leaf effect would produce (a mock, a
 * collected placeholder, and so on) and may record effects or mutate caller
 * state as a side effect. Structural `Parallel`/`Race` effects are resolved by
 * the caller inside `resolveEffect`, typically by driving their children. A
 * `Fail` node — or a {@link TaskExecutionError} thrown by `resolveEffect` —
 * unwinds to the nearest recovery frame; with none installed it throws
 * `TaskExecutionError`, matching the production interpreter. Any other thrown
 * value propagates unchanged.
 *
 * @typeParam A - The task's result type.
 * @param root - The task to drive.
 * @param resolveEffect - Produces the result for each leaf effect.
 * @returns The task's final value.
 * @note Impure — `resolveEffect` typically records effects or mutates caller
 * state.
