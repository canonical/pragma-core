   * during the walk. Composed with the walk's own virtual filesystem: a path
   * created earlier in the walk is always present, otherwise this resolver's
   * answer is the preferred resolution (subject to fail-backtracking, below).
   *
   * Without it, every `Exists` the walk itself did not satisfy prefers
   * `false` — which makes any task that branches on pre-existing host state
   * (`ifElseM(exists(p), ...)`) collect undos from the wrong branch.
   * `runUndo` (`@canonical/task/node`) always supplies a real-filesystem
   * resolver for exactly this reason; pass one here when collecting undos
   * for display so the preview matches what `runUndo` will execute.
   *
   * Note the deliberate asymmetry: `Exists` can be resolved against the host,
   * but `ReadFile` stays mocked. Reading real content during undo collection
   * would let the walk observe the forward run's own edits (e.g. an
   * append-if-absent helper would see the very line the forward run appended
   * and skip collecting its remove-line undo). Real existence + mocked
   * content is the contract.
   *
   * Known boundary: post-run host state cannot recover the PRE-run branch
   * when the forward run itself changed the answer and both branches
   * succeed at collection time — `ifElseM(exists(p), append, create)` over
   * an initially missing `p` collects the append branch's undo, not the
   * create branch's delete. That is the accepted cost of stateless undo (no
   * journal, by design); generators keep it benign by making the
   * existing-branch undo subsume the fresh-branch one (a remove-line undo
   * deletes the file when its removal leaves nothing behind).

 * branch. When an `Exists` resolution steers the walk into a failure (e.g. a
 * fail-if-present guard on a file the forward run itself created, which the

 * state only enters through the injected `resolveExists` — so it lives in the
 * base entry; executing the collected undos against the host is `runUndo`'s
 * job (`@canonical/task/node`).
 *
 * Each collected undo is the `undo` task exactly as its effect carries it —

 * (see {@link UndoTask}) — so executing the collected plan can echo each
 * undo's key on its outcome.
