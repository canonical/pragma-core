# Bumps the versions of packages and generates changelogs in a monorepo according to the Conventional Commits specification.
# It is intended to be run as part of a GitHub Actions workflow.
# INPUTS:
# $1: release_type (required) - The type of release to perform. Can be "stable" or a pre-release identifier (alpha, beta, rc, etc.,)
#   If "stable" is provided, the script will publish current pre-release versions as stable versions.
#   If a pre-release identifier is provided, updates will be applied s as pre-release versions (e.g., 0.0.1-alpha.0 -> 0.0.1-alpha.1), and will include the pre-release identifier in the tag.
# $2: tag_prefix (optional, default "v") - Prefix of the release git tag, used to check for tag collisions.
# OUTPUTS:
# $GITHUB_OUTPUT: The highest version number among all packages after the update is completed is written to "VERSION" in the $GITHUB_OUTPUT environment.
#
# Before the new version is accepted, the following release guards must pass:
# - Pre-releases must not bump the major version (temporary guard until 1.0.0).
# - The new version must be strictly greater than the current version in lerna.json.
# - The release git tag must not already exist locally or on origin.
# - The new version must be strictly greater than the highest version any public package has ever published to npm.
